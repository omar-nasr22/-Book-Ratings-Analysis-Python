# 📚 Book Ratings and Popularity Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a books dataset aimed at uncovering insights into reader preferences, book popularity, and trends in publishing over time.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess a real-world book dataset
- Analyze and visualize patterns in ratings, reviews, and publication years
- Identify the most popular and highly rated books
- Understand how reader behavior and ratings vary over time

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about books, including:
- **Book Name**
- **Author**
- **Book_average_rating**
- **Book_ratings_count**
- **Publishing Year**
- **Genre/Category**
- **publisher revenue**

> **Note:** The dataset was either downloaded from a public source (e.g. Kaggle/Goodreads) or provided as part of a learning challenge.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries

The analysis was conducted using:
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive coding and documentation

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data
- Converted columns to appropriate data types
- Removed duplicates and standardized text

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of book ratings and review counts
- Top-rated books vs. most reviewed books
- Rating trends over publication years
- Correlations between reviews, ratings, and publication date

### 3. Visualizations
- Histogram of ratings
- Scatter plot of number of ratings vs. average rating
- Line charts showing trends in publishing activity
- Bar charts for top authors/books

## 📌 Key Insights

- Books with a very high number of reviews tend to have moderate average ratings.
- Certain genres/authors consistently receive high ratings.
- There’s a significant rise in publication volume after the 2000s.
- Most books cluster around a 3.5–4.5 rating range.
